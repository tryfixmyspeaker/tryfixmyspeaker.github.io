        <h2>1. General Information</h2>

        <p>The information and services provided by TryFixMySpeaker are for general informational and utility purposes
            only. While we strive to provide an effective speaker cleaning solution, we make no representations or
            warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or
            availability of the website or the services contained herein.</p>

        <h2>2. No Guarantee of Results</h2>

        <p>TryFixMySpeaker provides a speaker cleaner tool based on sound wave technology designed to help remove water
            and dust from device speakers. However, <strong>we do not guarantee specific results or that the tool will
                fix all speaker issues.</strong></p>

        <p>The effectiveness of our water eject and dust removal features depends on various factors, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The extent and type of damage or blockage in your speakers</li>
            <li>The duration of water exposure or dust accumulation</li>
            <li>Your device's speaker design and configuration</li>
            <li>Whether the issue is caused by software or hardware problems</li>
            <li>The condition of your device's speakers before using the tool</li>
            <li>Environmental conditions and proper use of the tool</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>

        <p><strong>You use TryFixMySpeaker entirely at your own risk.</strong> We shall not be held liable for any
            damage, loss, or adverse effects resulting from the use of our speaker cleaner tool, including but not
            limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Damage to device speakers, hardware, or internal components</li>
            <li>Hearing damage from loud sounds (please adjust volume responsibly)</li>
            <li>Data loss or software malfunction</li>
            <li>Electrical damage or short circuits</li>
            <li>Voided warranties due to use of the tool</li>
            <li>Ineffective cleaning or worsened speaker conditions</li>
            <li>Any consequential damages arising from device malfunction</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Not a Replacement for Professional Repair</h2>

        <p>TryFixMySpeaker is designed as a <strong>supplementary maintenance tool and first-aid solution</strong> for
            minor speaker issues. It is not intended to replace professional device repair services or expert technical
            support.</p>

        <p>For serious issues, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speakers with physical damage (tears, cracks, or breaks)</li>
            <li>Devices that have been submerged in water for extended periods</li>
            <li>Speakers with persistent distortion after multiple cleaning attempts</li>
            <li>Devices exposed to corrosive liquids (salt water, chemicals, etc.)</li>
            <li>Complete speaker failure or no sound output</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We strongly recommend seeking professional repair services from qualified technicians or authorized service
            centers.</p>

        <h2>5. No Medical or Professional Advice</h2>

        <p>The content provided on TryFixMySpeaker does not constitute professional, technical, or medical advice. We
            are not device repair experts, audiologists, or medical professionals. Information on our website should not

            consult a qualified healthcare professional immediately.</p>

        <h2>6. Device Compatibility and Browser Requirements</h2>

        <p>TryFixMySpeaker relies on modern web technologies, including the Web Audio API and Vibration API. <strong>We
                do not guarantee compatibility with all devices, browsers, or operating systems.</strong></p>

        <p>The tool works best with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions)</li>
            <li>Devices with functional speakers and audio output</li>
            <li>Browsers that support Web Audio API</li>
            <li>Devices with vibration capabilities (for vibration mode)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Older browsers, unsupported devices, or outdated operating systems may not function properly with our tool.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Volume and Sound Safety Warning</h2>

        <p><strong>⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> Our speaker cleaner tool generates loud sounds and specific audio
            frequencies. Improper use may result in hearing damage or discomfort.</p>

        <p><strong>Safety precautions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not place your ear directly next to the speaker during operation</li>
            <li>Start with moderate volume and increase gradually if needed</li>
            <li>Do not use headphones or earbuds with this tool</li>
            <li>Keep the device away from pets and small children during use</li>
            <li>Discontinue use immediately if you experience discomfort</li>
            <li>Be aware of your surroundings to avoid disturbing others</li>
            <li>Do not use in quiet environments where loud sounds are inappropriate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>TryFixMySpeaker is <strong>not responsible for any hearing damage, discomfort, or injuries</strong> resulting
            from improper use of the tool.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRYFIXMYSPEAKER AND ITS OPERATORS SHALL NOT BE
                LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES</strong>,
            including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data</li>
            <li>Device damage, repair costs, or replacement expenses</li>
            <li>Interruption of service or loss of functionality</li>
            <li>Personal injury, hearing damage, or health issues</li>
            <li>Financial losses or business interruptions</li>
            <li>Any other tangible or intangible losses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

        <h2>9. Water Damage Considerations</h2>

        <p>While our water eject feature is designed to help remove water from speakers, <strong>it is not a
                comprehensive solution for water-damaged devices.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Important considerations for water damage:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn off your device immediately after water exposure if safe to do so</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to charge a wet device</li>
            <li>Our tool addresses speaker moisture but not internal water damage</li>
            <li>Water can cause corrosion, short circuits, and permanent damage</li>
            <li>For devices submerged in water, professional evaluation is recommended</li>
            <li>Salt water exposure requires immediate professional attention</li>
            <li>Our tool works best for minor splashes or humidity-related moisture</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Warranty and Device Guarantees</h2>

        <p><strong>Using TryFixMySpeaker may affect your device warranty.</strong> Some manufacturers may void
            warranties if users attempt DIY cleaning or repair methods. We are not responsible for any warranty
            violations or denied warranty claims resulting from use of our tool.</p>

        <p>Before using our speaker cleaner, consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Checking your device's warranty terms and conditions</li>
            <li>Contacting your manufacturer for approved cleaning methods</li>
            <li>Using authorized service centers for warranty-covered repairs</li>
